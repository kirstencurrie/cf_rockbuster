This is an intro to SQL project analyzing "Rockbuster" DVD Rental Sales as an introduction to relational databases.

The following information came from a fictional prompt in the Career Foundry's module #3 on SQL. 

## Objective

they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions theyâ€™d like to answer:

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
