FROM payment A
  INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
  INNER JOIN inventory C ON B.inventory_id = C.inventory_id
  INNER JOIN film D ON C.film_id = D. film_id
  INNER JOIN film_category E ON D.film_id = E.film_id
  INNER JOIN category F ON E.category_id = F.category_id
GROUP BY movie_name, movie_genre
ORDER BY sum_movie_revenue DESC
